## Abstract

Making language models bigger does not inherently make them better at following a user's intent. For example, large language models can generate outputs that are untruthful, toxic, or simply not helpful to the user. In other words, these models are not aligned with their users. In this paper, we show an avenue for aligning language models with user intent on a wide range of tasks by fine-tuning with human feedback. Starting with a set of labeler-written prompts and prompts submitted through the OpenAI API, we collect a dataset of labeler demonstrations of the desired model behavior, which we use to fine-tune GPT-3 using supervised learning. We then collect a dataset of rankings of model outputs, which we use to further fine-tune this supervised model using reinforcement learning from human feedback. We call the resulting models InstructGPT . In human evaluations on our prompt distribution, outputs from the 1.3B parameter InstructGPT model are preferred to outputs from the 175B GPT-3, despite having 100x fewer parameters. Moreover, InstructGPT models show improvements in truthfulness and reductions in toxic output generation while having minimal performance regressions on public NLP datasets. Even though InstructGPT still makes simple mistakes, our results show that fine-tuning with human feedback is a promising direction for aligning language models with human intent.

## 1 Introduction

Large language models (LMs) can be 'prompted' to perform a range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, given some examples of the task as input. However, these models often express unintended behaviors such as making up facts, generating biased or toxic text, or simply not following user instructions (Bender et al., 2021; Bommasani et al., 2021; Kenton et al., 2021; Weidinger et al., 2021; Tamkin et al., 2021; Gehman et al., 2020). This is because the language modeling objective

Figure 1: Human evaluations of various models on our API prompt distribution, evaluated by how often outputs from each model were preferred to those from the 175B SFT model. Our InstructGPT models (PPO-ptx) as well as its variant trained without pretraining mix (PPO) significantly outperform the GPT-3 baselines (GPT, GPT prompted); outputs from our 1.3B PPO-ptx model are preferred to those from the 175B GPT-3. Error bars throughout the paper are 95% confidence intervals.

used for many recent large LMs-predicting the next token on a webpage from the internet-is different from the objective 'follow the user's instructions helpfully and safely' (Radford et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020; Fedus et al., 2021; Rae et al., 2021; Thoppilan et al., 2022). Thus, we say that the language modeling objective is misaligned . Averting these unintended behaviors is especially important for language models that are deployed and used in hundreds of applications.

We make progress on aligning language models by training them to act in accordance with the user's intention (Leike et al., 2018). This encompasses both explicit intentions such as following instructions and implicit intentions such as staying truthful, and not being biased, toxic, or otherwise harmful. Using the language of Askell et al. (2021), we want language models to be helpful (they should help the user solve their task), honest (they shouldn't fabricate information or mislead the user), and harmless (they should not cause physical, psychological, or social harm to people or the environment). We elaborate on the evaluation of these criteria in Section 3.6.

We focus on fine-tuning approaches to aligning language models. Specifically, we use reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF; Christiano et al., 2017; Stiennon et al., 2020) to fine-tune GPT-3 to follow a broad class of written instructions (see Figure 2). This technique uses human preferences as a reward signal to fine-tune our models. We first hire a team of 40 contractors to label our data, based on their performance on a screening test (see Section 3.4 and Appendix B.1 for more details). We then collect a dataset of human-written demonstrations of the desired output behavior on (mostly English) prompts submitted to the OpenAI API 3 and some labeler-written prompts, and use this to train our supervised learning baselines. Next, we collect a dataset of human-labeled comparisons between outputs from our models on a larger set of API prompts. We then train a reward model (RM) on this dataset to predict which model output our labelers would prefer. Finally, we use this RM as a reward function and fine-tune our supervised learning baseline to maximize this reward using the PPO algorithm (Schulman et al., 2017). We illustrate this process in Figure 2. This procedure aligns the behavior of GPT-3 to the stated preferences of a specific group of people (mostly our labelers and researchers), rather than any broader notion of 'human values'; we discuss this further in Section 5.2. We call the resulting models InstructGPT .

We mainly evaluate our models by having our labelers rate the quality of model outputs on our test set, consisting of prompts from held-out customers (who are not represented in the training data). We also conduct automatic evaluations on a range of public NLP datasets. We train three model

sizes (1.3B, 6B, and 175B parameters), and all of our models use the GPT-3 architecture. Our main findings are as follows:

Labelers significantly prefer InstructGPT outputs over outputs from GPT-3. On our test set, outputs from the 1.3B parameter InstructGPT model are preferred to outputs from the 175B GPT-3, despite having over 100x fewer parameters. These models have the same architecture, and differ only by the fact that InstructGPT is fine-tuned on our human data. This result holds true even when we add a few-shot prompt to GPT-3 to make it better at following instructions. Outputs from our 175B InstructGPT are preferred to 175B GPT-3 outputs 85 ± 3% of the time, and preferred 71 ± 4% of the time to few-shot 175B GPT-3. InstructGPT models also generate more appropriate outputs according to our labelers, and more reliably follow explicit constraints in the instruction.

InstructGPT models show improvements in truthfulness over GPT-3. On the TruthfulQA benchmark, InstructGPT generates truthful and informative answers about twice as often as GPT-3. Our results are equally strong on the subset of questions that were not adversarially selected against GPT-3. On 'closed-domain' tasks from our API prompt distribution, where the output should not contain information that is not present in the input (e.g. summarization and closed-domain QA), InstructGPT models make up information not present in the input about half as often as GPT-3 (a 21% vs. 41% hallucination rate, respectively).

InstructGPT shows small improvements in toxicity over GPT-3, but not bias. To measure toxicity, we use the RealToxicityPrompts dataset (Gehman et al., 2020) and conduct both automatic and human evaluations. InstructGPT models generate about 25% fewer toxic outputs than GPT-3 when prompted to be respectful. InstructGPT does not significantly improve over GPT-3 on the Winogender (Rudinger et al., 2018) and CrowSPairs (Nangia et al., 2020) datasets.

We can minimize performance regressions on public NLP datasets by modifying our RLHF fine-tuning procedure. During RLHF fine-tuning, we observe performance regressions compared to GPT-3 on certain public NLP datasets, notably SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2018), DROP (Dua et al., 2019), HellaSwag (Zellers et al., 2019), and WMT 2015 French to English translation (Bojar et al., 2015). This is an example of an 'alignment tax' since our alignment procedure comes at the cost of

lower performance on certain tasks that we may care about. We can greatly reduce the performance regressions on these datasets by mixing PPO updates with updates that increase the log likelihood of the pretraining distribution (PPO-ptx), without compromising labeler preference scores.

Our models generalize to the preferences of 'held-out' labelers that did not produce any training data. To test the generalization of our models, we conduct a preliminary experiment with held-out labelers, and find that they prefer InstructGPT outputs to outputs from GPT-3 at about the same rate as our training labelers. However, more work is needed to study how these models perform on broader groups of users, and how they perform on inputs where humans disagree about the desired behavior.

Public NLP datasets are not reflective of how our language models are used. We compare GPT-3 fine-tuned on our human preference data (i.e. InstructGPT) to GPT-3 fine-tuned on two different compilations of public NLP tasks: the FLAN (Wei et al., 2021) and T0 (Sanh et al., 2021) (in particular, the T0++ variant). These datasets consist of a variety of NLP tasks, combined with natural language instructions for each task. On our API prompt distribution, our FLAN and T0 models perform slightly worse than our SFT baseline, and labelers significantly prefer InstructGPT to these models (InstructGPT has a 73.4 ± 2% winrate vs. our baseline, compared to 26.8 ± 2% and 29.8 ± 2% for our version of T0 and FLAN, respectively).

InstructGPT models show promising generalization to instructions outside of the RLHF finetuning distribution. We qualitatively probe InstructGPT's capabilities, and find that it is able to follow instructions for summarizing code, answer questions about code, and sometimes follows instructions in different languages, despite these instructions being very rare in the fine-tuning distribution. In contrast, GPT-3 can perform these tasks but requires more careful prompting, and does not usually follow instructions in these domains. This result is exciting because it suggests that our models are able to generalize the notion of 'following instructions.' They retain some alignment even on tasks for which they get very little direct supervision signal.

InstructGPT still makes simple mistakes. For example, InstructGPT can still fail to follow instructions, make up facts, give long hedging answers to simple questions, or fail to detect instructions with false premises.

Overall, our results indicate that fine-tuning large language models using human preferences significantly improves their behavior on a wide range of tasks, though much work remains to be done to improve their safety and reliability.

The rest of this paper is structured as follows: We first detail related work in Section 2, before diving into our method and experiment details in Section 3, including our high-level methodology (3.1), task and dataset details (3.3 and 3.2), human data collection (3.4), how we trained our models (3.5), and our evaluation procedure (3.6). We then present our results in Section 4, divided into three parts: results on the API prompt distribution (4.1), results on public NLP datasets (4.2), and qualitative results (4.3). Finally we give an extended discussion of our work in Section 5, including implications for alignment research (5.1), what we are aligning to (5.2), limitations (5.3), open questions (5.4), and broader impacts of this work (5.5).

## 2 Related work

Research on alignment and learning from human feedback. We build on previous techniques to align models with human intentions, particularly reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Originally developed for training simple robots in simulated environments and Atari games (Christiano et al., 2017; Ibarz et al., 2018), it has recently been applied to fine-tuning language models to summarize text (Ziegler et al., 2019; Stiennon et al., 2020; Böhm et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2021). This work is in turn influenced by similar work using human feedback as a reward in domains such as dialogue (Jaques et al., 2019; Yi et al., 2019; Hancock et al., 2019), translation (Kreutzer et al., 2018; Bahdanau et al., 2016), semantic parsing (Lawrence and Riezler, 2018), story generation (Zhou and Xu, 2020), review generation (Cho et al., 2018), and evidence extraction (Perez et al., 2019). Madaan et al. (2022) use written human feedback to augment prompts and improve the performance of GPT-3. There has also been work on aligning agents in text-based environments using RL with

a normative prior (Nahian et al., 2021). Our work can be seen as a direct application of RLHF to aligning language models on a broad distribution of language tasks.

The question of what it means for language models to be aligned has also received attention recently (Gabriel, 2020). Kenton et al. (2021) catalog behavioral issues in LMs that result from misalignment, including producing harmful content and gaming misspecified objectives. In concurrent work, Askell et al. (2021) propose language assistants as a testbed for alignment research, study some simple baselines, and their scaling properties.

Training language models to follow instructions. Our work is also related to research on crosstask generalization in language models, where LMs are fine-tuned on a broad range of public NLP datasets (usually prefixed with an appropriate instruction) and evaluated on a different set of NLP tasks. There has been a range of work in this domain (Yi et al., 2019; Mishra et al., 2021; Wei et al., 2021; Khashabi et al., 2020; Sanh et al., 2021; Aribandi et al., 2021), which differ in training and evaluation data, formatting of instructions, size of pretrained models, and other experimental details. A consistent finding across studies is that fine-tuning LMs on a range of NLP tasks, with instructions, improves their downstream performance on held-out tasks, both in the zero-shot and few-shot settings.

There is also a related line of work on instruction following for navigation, where models are trained to follow natural language instructions to navigate in a simulated environment (Bahdanau et al., 2018; Abramson et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2021).

Evaluating the harms of language models. Agoal of modifying the behavior of language models is to mitigate the harms of these models when they're deployed in the real world. These risks have been extensively documented (Bender et al., 2021; Bommasani et al., 2021; Kenton et al., 2021; Weidinger et al., 2021; Tamkin et al., 2021). Language models can produce biased outputs (Dhamala et al., 2021; Liang et al., 2021; Manela et al., 2021; Caliskan et al., 2017; Kirk et al., 2021), leak private data (Carlini et al., 2021), generate misinformation (Solaiman et al., 2019; Buchanan et al., 2021), and be used maliciously; for a thorough review we direct the reader to Weidinger et al. (2021). Deploying language models in specific domains gives rise to new risks and challenges, for example in dialog systems (Henderson et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2020; Dinan et al., 2019b). There is a nascent but growing field that aims to build benchmarks to concretely evaluate these harms, particularly around toxicity (Gehman et al., 2020), stereotypes (Nadeem et al., 2020), and social bias (Dhamala et al., 2021; Nangia et al., 2020; Rudinger et al., 2018). Making significant progress on these problems is hard since well-intentioned interventions on LM behavior can have side-effects (Welbl et al., 2021; Blodgett et al., 2020); for instance, efforts to reduce the toxicity of LMs can reduce their ability to model text from under-represented groups, due to prejudicial correlations in the training data (Xu et al., 2021).

Modifying the behavior of language models to mitigate harms. There are many ways to change the generation behavior of language models. Solaiman and Dennison (2021) fine-tune LMs on a small, value-targeted dataset, which improves the models' ability to adhere to these values on a question answering task. Ngo et al. (2021) filter the pretraining dataset by removing documents on which a language model has a high conditional likelihood of generating a set of researcher-written trigger phrases. When trained on this filtered dataset, their LMs generate less harmful text, at the cost of a slight decrease in language modeling performance. Xu et al. (2020) use a variety of approaches to improve the safety of chatbots, including data filtering, blocking certain words or n-grams during generation, safety-specific control tokens (Keskar et al., 2019; Dinan et al., 2019a), and human-in-theloop data collection (Dinan et al., 2019b). Other approaches for mitigating the generated bias by LMs use word embedding regularization (Liu et al., 2019; Huang et al., 2019), data augmentation (Liu et al., 2019; Dinan et al., 2019a; Sheng et al., 2019), null space projection to make the distribution over sensitive tokens more uniform (Liang et al
